		   <p>Digital media drove a shift in marketers’ budgets to “always-on” digital media, such as search, display, and social.  That focus is moving now to “always relevant” marketing. For brands and their agencies, this shift requires a much more sophisticated and targeted approach to address the ubiquity of touch points so that they can be there at a consumer’s moment of need—no matter where or when it is. In this environment, advertising needs to become a service.</p>

<h2 id="on-demand-marketing">On-demand Marketing</h2>
<p>On-demand Marketing is usually explained as market only travellers have the a need or even public discussion on the service or product you’re selling. Superior analytics are assisting companies sense communications and respond with real-time with written content tailored to just about every customer “touch. ” NFC potato chips in phones, together with smart tags which could go on virtually any object, are opening up an “Internet of things” that is certainly intelligent, interactive, and also always accessible. Breakthroughs in cell technology are creating thousands of ways to touch base with consumers. As these opportunities to touch base with the client multiply, brands will need to have clear strategies to meet three primary customer demands: anywhere/anytime accessibility, personally relevant, and simple to use.</p>

<p>They will wield mobile tech like smartphone samurai and also have increasingly high expectations on the brands they visit—be the idea online, on the phone or directly.

<div class="ui highlight">67% Customer decisions based on experiences with brands and categories, rather than price.</div>

<p>To win over on-demand customers, brands must know them, what they assume, and what works with him or her, and then have the chance to reach them with the right kind of interaction. Data lies in the middle of these efforts. To build the necessary level connected with understanding, companies need several distinct data lenses.</p>

<p>A particular view of the vast and long-term trends on the market, category, and brand is vital. Digital sources that track what people are trying to find (search), what people say (social monitoring), and what folks are doing (tracking online, mobile, and in-store activities) signify rivers of input providing constant warning signs of trouble or indicators of latent opportunity. Many companies are drowning in reports from vendors providing most of these information tools, yet few have a lot clarity on which things they have to look for and who must know what.</p>
